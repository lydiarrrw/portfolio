        I first opened the terminal in 2019, in preparation for starting the software engineering bootcamp I completed, 
        and at the time I felt like a hacker. Obviously at that point I knew very little about anything tech related really, 
        a feeling that I think we all still have no matter how much experience we have.
      </p>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        Since then though I have learnt an awful lot about building websites, how things can go wrong and that it’s really 
        fun to go to this website <a href="https://hackertyper.net/" class="blog_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" title="Opens hackertyper.net in a new tab">hackertyper.net</a> and pretend to non-technical friends that you’re doing something important.

      <h2><span class="blog_highlight">WHY CYBER SEC?</span></h2>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        As there is always something else to know, I’m now carrying on growing in my career by diving into cyber security.
         I’m hoping to learn not only how to defend applications from common threats, but also how attackers think and operate. 
         With my background in web development, I’ve seen firsthand how small mistakes in code or configuration can lead to 
         big problems, so understanding security feels like the natural next step.
      </p>
      <h2><span class="blog_highlight">WHAT'S NEXT?</span></h2>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        My aim is to be part of creating more resilient applications, help teams write safer code, and eventually contribute 
        to security practices that protect users and businesses alike. Cyber security excites me because it combines 
        curiosity, problem-solving, and a bit of detective work - all things I love.
      </p>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        I’ve started my learning journey, easing myself in with PortSwigger exercises and (apprentice) labs and will keep 
        my blog updated with some of the things I learn!
