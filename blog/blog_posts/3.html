      <p class="blog_post-text">
        I had some very exciting news this week, at least for me, when I received an email from 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://vercel.com/" class="external-link-text">Vercel</a> letting me 
        know that there was a security flaw in certain versions of the framework. Probably not such exciting news for them!
      </p>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        The issue turned out to be a security vulnerability in some React components, tracked as 
        CVE-2025-55182, also known as react2shell. (And then a few further issues in a separate email).
      </p>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        This vulnerability affects projects using certain versions of Next.js and React. 
        Thankfully, a fix was released pretty quickly, but there was already a proof of concept available meaning 
        attackers could potentially figure out how to exploit it if projects weren’t updated.
      </p>

      <h2><span class="blog_highlight">WHAT IS THE VULNERABILITY?</span></h2>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        In simple terms, researchers discovered that if an attacker carefully crafts data in just the right way, 
        they can trick the system into running any JavaScript code they want.
      </p>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        This happens because the framework didn’t properly check what type of data it was receiving. Instead of only 
        allowing safe, expected types, it could be persuaded to reference internal types that were never meant to be exposed.
      </p>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        By chaining these types together, an attacker could eventually create a hidden (anonymous) function and then 
        execute it, passing in malicious JavaScript. This chain can be disguised as a normal asynchronous process 
        (using promises), which makes it harder to spot.
      </p>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        This kind of issue is commonly referred to as Remote Code Execution (RCE), one of the more serious 
        categories of security vulnerabilities.
      </p>
      <h2><span class="blog_highlight">WHAT DID I DO?</span></h2>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        The email linked to a page with clear instructions on what to do next, so the first thing I did was check my 
        live sites that use Next.js and React.
      </p>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        I found one project running a vulnerable version. Then, a little later, I received another email pointing out 
        additional issues so I had to update a more recent project too.
      </p>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        I followed the instructions on Vercel’s security bulletin:
        <a target="_blank" href="https://vercel.com/kb/bulletin/react2shell" class="external-link-text">https://vercel.com/kb/bulletin/react2shell</a>
      </p>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        Using the command line, I ran:
        <code>
          npx fix-react2shell-next
        </code>
      </p>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        After that, I added the changes, committed them, pushed everything up, and redeployed the projects.
      </p>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        While my hobby sites are unlikely to be the target of international cyber attacks, it still felt 
        important to apply the fix. And for large organisations using Next.js at scale, this was obviously a much 
        bigger and more urgent problem.
      </p>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        I also came across a really interesting Reddit thread where developers discuss how they’re handling this 
        and similar vulnerabilities including detection, prevention, and staying ready to update quickly. You can
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/devsecops/comments/1pfzm6x/react2shell_cve202555182_how_are_you_wiring_this/" class="external-link-text">read it here</a>
      </p>

      <h2><span class="blog_highlight">A NEW ACRONYM FOR ME</span></h2>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        One small but important thing I learned is that CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.
      </p>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        CVE is a program that tracks and catalogues publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities, 
        making it easier for developers and organisations to talk about and respond to specific issues.
      </p>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        You can read more about it here:
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cve.org/" class="external-link-text">https://www.cve.org/</a>
      </p>

      <h2><span class="blog_highlight">HOW TO PREVENT THESE VULNERABILITIES</span></h2>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        This experience definitely reinforced a few basics for me:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use strong type checking</li>
        <li>Keep track of the versions of software I’m using</li>
        <li>Update dependencies regularly instead of letting them drift too far behind</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        None of this guarantees safety, but it massively reduces risk.
      </p>

      <h2><span class="blog_highlight">THIS ALSO GOT ME THINKING...</span></h2>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        I found it interesting that I was notified about this vulnerability by Vercel, where my projects are hosted. 
        It raised an interesting question for me: when should vulnerabilities be disclosed publicly?
      </p>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        On one hand, publishing details could encourage exploitation. On the other hand, people need to know about 
        vulnerabilities so they can fix them.
      </p>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        This reminded me of an episode of Darknet Diaries where a man discovered serious vulnerabilities in his new 
        router, including the fact that it didn’t require a password. He responsibly reported the issue to the company, 
        but they mostly ignored his concerns. Eventually, he made the information public so people could protect themselves.
      </p>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        Personally, I’d want to know if my devices or software had security flaws, especially if fixing them was as 
        simple as changing a setting or applying an update.
      </p>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        You can find the episode here: 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://darknetdiaries.com/transcript/5/" class="external-link-text">https://darknetdiaries.com/transcript/5/</a>
      </p>

      <h2><span class="blog_highlight">FINAL THOUGHTS</span></h2>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        This whole experience has made me realise I shouldn’t ignore those GitHub Dependabot emails I get. 
        I have it enabled on one of my projects that isn’t live, so I hadn’t paid much attention to the alerts before. 
        They are probably actually quite interesting!
      </p>
      <p class="blog_post-text">
        Now, instead of seeing them as noise, I can see them as an opportunity to learn more about vulnerabilities
         and how they affect real projects.
